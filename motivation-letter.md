Dear Professor Cook,
\bigskip

Please consider our article titled "animbook: Visualizing Changes in Performance Measures and Demographic Affiliations Using Animation" for publication in the R journal.

The manuscript introduces the new package called `animbook` which provides new visualization functions to generate an animation. This animation is used for visualizing the changes in the categorical data that are measured over time. It also delves into the data format required, considerations for creating animations, and visual design.

We believe the readers of the R Journal will find this article helpful for their work because it provides generally useful instructions that will work for many purposes.

NOTES: Modify this file with information about your article. 

1. It may be invisible to you, so be aware that after each address line there are two spaces, this makes the line break correctly.
2. It is also reasonable to submit an .md format of your motivating letter instead of a pdf.
